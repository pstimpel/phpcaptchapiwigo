With the original version of this plugin I still received to much spam. 
This fork replaces the presented captcha image with an iframe showing a table of slices of the images.

## About

A small and lightweight Captcha solution to keep your installation free from bot spam comments and bot fake registrations.

It does not rely on any remote resources - like Recaptcha from Google or any others. This means you do not have to mention it in your GDPR compliance declaration. If Google enables Recaptcha V3 soon, Recaptcha will act like a tracker, since the advice is to implement it on every single page of your website. You will dislike this, hopefully.

Installation is as easy as with any other plugin. Since this plugin does not use any database tables it does not matter which MySQL version you are using.

The Captcha works the classic way. There are some configuration options like colors, OCR confusion, dimensions and length of challenge. Just explore the possibilities in the plugin area of Piwigo admin.

Yes, it is the 5th or so Captcha solution, but all other solutions rely on remote resources or are not maintained anymore.

Would love to receive feedback.
